# Octave-Works
this repository is for some works or evaluations of my university

also learning about git and github :D


i dont know what i doing here writing some b**lsh*t ... but ...


what you still reading this?... get out of my repository man... CHISMOSO


The works that I upload here only run with the problem explained in the code, but changing some lines in the functions and specific requirement would be enough. :D

to run the code without octave or matlab, use console (cmd) and search the directory where you donwload the code, and only writing the name of file and press enter the code tun on your console.
